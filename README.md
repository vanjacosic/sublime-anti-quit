Sublime Anti Quit
=================

Accidental quitting protection for Sublime Text 3. A very simple plugin.

## Usage

The plugin is automatically mapped to the quit keyboard shortcut, to prevent you from accidentally closing Sublime. A prompt will appear, asking if you are sure you want to quit. Press `enter` to quit and `esc` to dismiss it.

The default OS mappings are:

OS X: `Cmd+q` - Windows: `Alt+F4` - Linux: `Ctrl+q`


## Installation

The plugin is not in Package Control yet.

Untill it is, the easiest way is to clone this repo into your Packages folder.

Example (OS X):

	$ git clone git@github.com:vanjacosic/sublime-anti-quit.git ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 3/Packages
	

## Notes

This plugin is released under the MIT License.

This is my first Sublime plugin, so please let me know if there is something to improve or do in a better way. Feel free to open an issue or a pull request.
