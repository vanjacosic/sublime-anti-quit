Sublime Anti Quit
=================

 A very simple plugin, that provides accidental-quitting protection for Sublime Text 2 and 3.

## Usage

The plugin is automatically mapped to the quit keyboard shortcut, to prevent you from accidentally closing Sublime. A prompt will appear, asking if you are sure you want to quit. Press `enter` to quit and `esc` to dismiss it.

The default OS mappings are:

OS X: `Cmd+q` - Windows: `Alt+F4` - Linux: `Ctrl+q`


## Installation

The plugin is not in Package Control yet.

Untill it is, the easiest way is to clone this repo into your Packages folder.

Clone url: `git@github.com:vanjacosic/sublime-anti-quit.git`

Packages path: `~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 2/Packages/AntiQuit` 

Example (OS X):

	$ git clone git@github.com:vanjacosic/sublime-anti-quit.git ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 2/Packages/AntiQuit
	
*Note: If you use Sublime Text 3, just replace the `2` with a `3` in the path.*
